# Movie Night Planner

**Movie Night Planner** is a tool designed for small friend groups or roommates to coordinate weekly movie nights.

The system reduces decision fatigue, improves shared planning, and makes tracking movies more fun and social.

## Project Goals

- Help users plan weekly movie nights together
- Provide each user with a personalized movie wishlist
- Enable social features to suggest what to watch together
